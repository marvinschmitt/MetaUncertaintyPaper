This repository contains the code for the paper _Meta-Uncertainty in Bayesian Model Comparison_: [https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07278](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07278)


Note that the R code is structured as a package, thus requiring a local installation with subsequent loading via `library(MetaUncertaintyPaper)`.

## Installation Instructions

### The `{ggsimplex}` plot package
The current paper code uses a highly experimental version of the [ggsimplex](https://github.com/marvinschmitt/ggsimplex) R package. Install it from GitHub via

```
devtools::install_github('marvinschmitt/ggsimplex')
```

### R environment
The R environment is captured with `renv`. Install the `renv` package and load the environment with 

```
renv::restore()
```

### Python environment
The package requirements of the Python environment (except BayesFlow, see below) are captured in the `requirements.txt` file. Recreate the environment using

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The amortized model comparison network (BayesFlow) in Experiment 3 uses [BayesFlow](https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow) at commit  `c4208418ad19b6648be216cfe013c8f5317a652c`: https://github.com/stefanradev93/BayesFlow/tree/c4208418ad19b6648be216cfe013c8f5317a652c.

Should you fail to install this BayesFlow version or encounter unexpected errors, you can load the trained neural networks' weights from the folder `python/checkpoints_exp3/` and avoid re-training the network.
